# Microflow

A set of tools to make it easier to start prototyping for interactivity.

Microflow consists of 2 applications so far:

1. Microflow studio
2. Microflow hardware bridge (Figma plugin)

## Microflow studio

Microflow studio is a desktop application that allows you to create interactive prototypes using a visual, flow-based, interface.

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/xiduzo/microflow/releases) and get started.


## Microflow hardware bridge

Microflow hardware bridge is a Figma plugin that allows you to connect your Figma designs to the Microflow studio application.

Microflow hardware bridge also allows you to connect to your MQTT broker of choice and does not require the Microflow studio application to get started.
