An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a simple output device that emits light when an electric current passes through it.
LEDs are commonly used in electronics projects to indicate the status of a circuit or to provide visual feedback.

## LED - RGB

Compared to a regular LED, a RGB LED allows you to individually control the intensity of each of the three primary colors (Red, Green, and Blue) that make up the LED.

## LED - matrix
For now, only basic `8x8` LED matrixes are supported.

You are able to customise the display of the matrix by an embedded editor in Microflow. This editor allows you to draw a sequence of frames that will be displayed on the matrix.

The frame that will be displayed can be configured by passing in a the numeric value in the `show` handle of the node.

The frames start counting from `0`, meaning the first frame is `0`, the second frame is `1`, and so on.
