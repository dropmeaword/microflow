title: Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of any flow.

They are the basic units of computation and can be connected to each other to form a flow. Nodes can be of different types, such as input, output, or processing nodes. Each node has a set of properties that define its behavior and configuration.

By connecting nodes together, using [edges](/docs/microflow-studio/edges), you can create complex interactions that perform a wide range of tasks.

For example, you can create a flow that reads data from a sensor, processes the data, and then sends the result to an output device.
