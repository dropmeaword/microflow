A `comparison` statement is a fundamental control structure in programming that allows you to make decisions based on certain conditions.

The `Compare` node validates the input [edge](/docs/microflow-studio/edges) to either be _truthy_ or _falsy_.

When you would not like to match exact values, you can use the [`Trigger`](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/trigger) node.
