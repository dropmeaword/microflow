Control high voltage devices with a relay. A relay is an electrically operated switch that allows you to control a high-power circuit with a low-power signal -- like that from a microcontroller.

{% callout type="warning" title="DANGER: LETHAL VOLTAGE" %}
Working with high voltage can be `DEADLY`. Even a momentary lapse in caution can result in severe injury or `DEATH`.

Never attempt to handle high voltage circuits without proper knowledge and always work under the supervision of a qualified expert. Your life is on the line.
