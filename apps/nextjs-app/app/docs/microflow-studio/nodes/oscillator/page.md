An oscillator is an way to produce a periodic, oscillating or alternating signal. This signal can be produced in a variation of wave forms.

You can use an oscillator to generate a signal that can be used as an input for other nodes in your flow. For example, you can use an oscillator to generate a sine wave that can be used as an input for the intensity of the [vibration of a haptic device](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/vibration).
