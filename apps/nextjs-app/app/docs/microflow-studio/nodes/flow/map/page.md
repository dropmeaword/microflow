Transforms a number from one range to another.

For example mapping the number 50 which is in the range of 0 to 100 to the range of 0 to 10 would result in 5.

Mapping a number does not always have to be linear. You can map _any_ input range to _any_ output range.

As seen in the example above, the output can also be a range that is outside of the input range.
