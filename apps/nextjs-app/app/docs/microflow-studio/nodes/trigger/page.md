When you do not want to match exact values like in the [compare](/docs/microflow-studio/nodes/compare) node, you can use the `Trigger` node.

This node will give you the ability to trigger when certain events happen with your data.

For example, when the temperature of a room increases above a certain threshold, you can trigger an event to turn on the air conditioning.
